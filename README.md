In this Project, i bought together many of the tools and techniques that I have learned throughout my course.
The course includes more than 40 videos that cover a broad range of ML topics. I have to create an application which students can use to quickly locate and view video content by searching for topics and key phrases.
I downloaded all of the videos to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.
Then I transcribed the videos, normalized the text. Extracted key phrases and topics from the videos and created a dashboard to search.
